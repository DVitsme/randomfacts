# A Simple Random Fact Generator

```bash
This app will allow users to click a button and generate a random fact. Facts will be stored in a airtable database to be displayed to the user as a list when loading in.
The list will be sorted by date, but may add the option to allow it to be sorted by highest voted as well.
The list will load 10 by default with a load more option.
```

```bash
Each fact will be able to be selected and voted.
Each fact will be displayed on its on unique page.
Each fact will have its own picture that will be generated by taking the first 10 char from the fact and piping it into unplash then taking the first image from that array and setting it as its hero.
Each fact will have an associated src
```
